# Crime_Data
This data set is over the top 5 crimes in Austin TX, over the course of 2018-2021 (COVID era).  The basis of this data set is to take apart a common misconception in big cities.  Did crime rate go up during and after covid following 2018?  Or did it go up?

IMPORTANT NOTE: The CSV was not uploaded with this repo only because the csv data set was too large to incorporate into github.  The official website for this data set is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?tags=crime&organization=city-of-austin
