# Crime_Data
This data set is over the top 3 crimes in Austin TX, over the course of 2019-2021 (COVID era).  The basis of this data set is to take apart a common misconception in big cities.  Did crime rate go up during and after covid following 2019?  Or did it go up?

IMPORTANT NOTE: The CSV was not uploaded with this repo only because the csv data set was too large to incorporate into github.  The official website for this data set is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?tags=crime&organization=city-of-austin
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-reports-bf2b7  (this is the specific one.  The first web information is the navigation page to this one)


The information found for the code analysis was ideas from StackOverflow and from previous class work.  All was for reference only!
